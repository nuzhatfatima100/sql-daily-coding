Sending vs. Opening Snaps
Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:

Calculate the following percentages:
time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.






with cte1 as(
select age_bucket,
sum(case when act.activity_type='send' then time_spent else 0 end) as send_time,
sum(case when act.activity_type='open' then time_spent else 0 end) as open_time,
sum(time_spent) as total_time
from activities act 
left join age_breakdown as ab 
on act.user_id=ab.user_id
where activity_type in ('send','open')
group by age_bucket)

select age_bucket, round(100.0 * send_time/total_time,2) as send_perc,
round(100.0 * open_time/total_time,2) as open_perc
from cte1
